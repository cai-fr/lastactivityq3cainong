     <h1>Elon Musk claims Apple has 'threated to withhold' Twitter from its app store</h1>

		<p style="font-family: Verdana;"><b>New York CNN Business</b>—Elon Musk on Monday claimed that Apple has "threatened" to pull Twitter from its IOS app store, a move that could be devastating to the company Musk just acquired for $44 billion.</p>

		<p style="font-family: Verdana;"><em>"Apple (<u>AAPL</u>) has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won't tell us why,"</em>Musk said in one of several tweets Monday taking aim at Apple (<u>AAPL</u>) and its CEO for alleged moves that could undermine Twitter's business.</p>

		<p style="font-family: Verdana;">In another tweet, Musk claimed that Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. <em>“Do they hate free speech in America,”</em> he said, in an apparent reference to his oft-stated desire to bolster his idea of free speech on the platform. <em>“What’s going on here [Apple CEO Tim Cook]?”</em> Musk added in a follow-up tweet. He also <u>criticized</u> Apple’s size, <u>claimed</u> it engages in “censorship,” and <u>called out</u> the 30% transaction fee Apple charges large app developers to be listed in its app store.</p>

		<p style="font-family: Verdana;">In one tweet Monday, Musk asked his nearly 120 million followers if they know <em>“Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?”</em> In another tweet, he posted a picture of a highway exit: one lane headed toward <em>“pay 30%,”</em> the other pointed toward “go to war.” An old car labeled “Elon” skidded toward the latter.</p>
