	<h1>"Every day is leg day"</h1>
		<p>I worked for Royale High as a fashion designer and as a model. I am very skilled at creating unique outfits, each with unique styles.
		<br>
		<br>
		Before I resigned, I would go to the Royale High Intergalactic Trading Hub to show my art works and sell some parts of it. 
		This job has helped me develop a sense of style and fashion that I will apply to every outfit that I will wear as days, weeks, months, years, and centuries go by.
