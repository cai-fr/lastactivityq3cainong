			I’m an <font color=violet size=14><b>artist</b></font>, and as everyone knows, artists are usually rather poor.<br>

			Normally, I don’t mind about that. When the sun is shining, I sit <br>

			on my favourite <font color=green size=14><u>blade of grass</u></font> and play music for everyone to listen to. <br>

			I have lots of friends, and together we’ve formed an orchestra.</p>

			<p align=center>

			Everyone loves our music and says how cheerful it makes them feel – well almost everyone.<br>

			There’s a <font color=violet size=14><b>family of ants</b></font> who never stop to listen. They take themselves far too seriously for music or enjoyment.<br>
			
			All they do is work, work, work – even when the sun is shining.</p>

			<p align=center>
			
			“Hey You <font color=violet size=14><b>Ants</b></font>,” I said to them. “It’s a lovely <font color=green size=14><u>summer’s day</u></font>. Why don’t you rest your feet for a while, and listen to my sweet music?”<br>
			
			“No time to stop,” one of them said, panting away. “We’re far too busy stocking up food for <font color=green size=14><u>winter.</u></font>”<br>
			
			<font color=red size=12><sup>The months went by, and the days got shorter and colder. I was shivering so much that I couldn’t even sing.</sup></font></p>
			
			<p align=center><font color=red size=12><sup>A hard frost was on the ground, and there wasn’t a crumb to eat. I was so hungry!</sup></font><br>

			<font color=red size=12><sup>So I went to see that busy</sup></font> <font color=violet size=14><b>family of ants</b></font> <font color=red size=12><sup>and said: “Please Sirs, I’m <font color=violet size=14><b>a poor starving musician.</b></font><br>

			Spare me a few crumbs from your store of food.”</sup></font></p>

			<font color=blue size=12><sub>Do you know what? Those</sub></font> <font color=violet size=14><b>ants</b></font> <font color=blue size=12><sub>
			just turned their noses up at me.</sub></font><br>

			<font color=blue size=12><sub>They were so stingy that they wouldn’t share any of their food.</sub></font><br>

			<font color=blue size=12><sub>Oh well, I’ll just have to go hungry this</sub></font> <font color=green size=14><u>winter.</u></font>

			<font color=blue size=12><sub>In the New Year, I’ll make a resolution.</sub></font><br>

			<font color=yellow size=14><i>When the times are good, I’ll remember to save some food for a rainy day.</i></font></p>
